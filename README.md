# NodeJs Validator #

## Introduction ##

This is a play around validation tool for validating requests to a restful Api

## Intention ##

The intention is to pratice unit testing and play around with validation logic. Eventually I will use the tool within my own Apis but I'm aware there will already be packages out there that are much better than this one. It is just for my enjoyment :)

## Road map ##

* Support validating data type
* Support min, max, minLength and maxLength
* Support regex
* Support datetime
* Support minlength for array
* Support validating child objects
* Support custom validation function
* Create promise method where any issues will be treated as a reject
* Create functional method with Express so that rejection can automatically be returned as a 400
